### Story behind this
On September 16 2015 at exactly 10:16, I got bored. Bored of not being able to remember where I keep my stuff. Here is what happened...

I was looking for a specific code snippet. I knew I worked on an Ajax-Powered contact form a few months, but on which project was it? When was it? Was for a client or a project? No idea.

So, I decided to start from scratch and store this a public repository so that next time I need where to look. Next time, I won't tear my hair out. And perhaps, others will find it useful.

### About
I wanted to play with [Bootstrap 4](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/) to get familiar and be able to use it as soon as it's out. I also wanted to benchmark Geolocation APIs, so I ran tests to determine which service has the quickest response time. And more importantly, I'm always striving to improve my workflow.
